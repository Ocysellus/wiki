*Prerequisites*: Most content on this topic assumes some mathematical proof techniques (incl. mathematical induction) and basic knowledge of [naive set theory](/math/set). The following books might be a good refresher:

* Daniel J. Velleman.
***How to Prove It: A Structured Approach.***
* Paul Halmos.
***Naive Set Theory.***

The first book also provides a fair introduction to propositional (sentential) logic.
