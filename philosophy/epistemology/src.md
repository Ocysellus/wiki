Epistemology is the study of knowledge.

# Hypothesis

A *hypothesis* is a proposed explanation or prediction method for a phenomenon. Only statistically tested hypothesis may become common knowledge.

**Epicurus' principle of multiple explanations.**
If multiple hypotheses are consistent with the observed data, one should retain them all.

**Occam's razor.**
Among all hypotheses consistent with the observations, choose the simplest.
